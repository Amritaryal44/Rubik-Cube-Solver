    RUBIKâ€™S CUBE SOLVER

Step I :

 For example, choose the front central color as blue and up central color as yellow. Keep the cube showing blue central face as front and yellow central face as up. Choose the color of front face as per asked by the program.

If the program has asked for down face colors,Bring the down face to front of your eyes. After entering colors for down face, the program will ask for right face colors. First bring the blue central face to front then after that bring the right face to front of your eyes. Simiar procedures can be applied For rest of the faces for entering colors and you are done with first step.

 

Step II:

            Turn or rotate the cube as per commanded by the program. This time the right face after bringing it to front of eyes becomes front face unlike the above step.

            While rotating cube, you should only see the front face in orthographic view.
